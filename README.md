# We-Love-Dogs! :)

In this project, I wanted to express how much I love dogs.

Deployed on Firebase. **[click here](https://dog-api-73374.web.app/)** to check out the website.

**How does it work?**:

The website first fetches all dog breeds from **[this website](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)**.
Users can choose to see all dog breeds or one one dog breed
After choosing the dog breed, it will display three cute dog pictures from the dog API.

**Utilized**: ReactJS, Firebase, DOG API, Custom hook, React Testing Library, and Jest

Best wishes,
